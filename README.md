Unit13-challenge: RoboAdvisor

I spent several hours with AskBCS to try and figure out why the bot was not providing errors when an age over 65 or initial investment amount was under 5000 and they were not able to figure out the issue. They said the code looked fine and it was likely and error with Amazon Lex and that they were going to report the issue to the university.
